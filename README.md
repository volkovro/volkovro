  Unfortunately, github has become inconvenient for me.

Due to the need to use tokens, ssh keys and two-factor authentication, I spend too much time micromanaging my authentication data instead of just sitting down at a new device and writing code whenever I want.

I will continue to post new tools and updates on [ðŸ•·notabug.orgðŸ•·](https://www.notabug.org/volkovro "notabug.org"), but I won't mirror here, even if such a feature appears. 

 ðŸ§Ÿ Projects that I will no longer update :

  * [Mail-sender](https://github.com/volkovro/mail-sender "github.com") - *Utility for sending the output of console programs to the mail*
  * [Mikrotik-backups](https://github.com/volkovro/mikrotik-backups "github.com") - *Script for centralized collection of backup copies of mikrotik devices*
  * [Incirrate](https://github.com/volkovro/incirrate "github.com") - *Ansible of a healthy person*

 ðŸŒ± Projects planned for this year :

  * While I'm doing nothing :/
  
  ðŸ”« Projects for fun that are not worth paying attention to :
  
  * [Linux-workspace](https://www.notabug.org/volkovro/linux-workspace "notabug.org") - *Portable linux workspace on docker*
  * [Stendadmin](https://www.notabug.org/volkovro/stendadmin "notabug.org") - *Utility for sequential startup pipeline stages gitlab-ci*
